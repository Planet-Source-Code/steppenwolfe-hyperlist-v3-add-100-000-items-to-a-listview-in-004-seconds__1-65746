HyperList VIII

.:Library Version:.

Both the HyperListDll, and prjHyperHarness projects use the qs5lib.tlb type library.
A type library must be registered before it can be used, but this is easy if you simply follow these steps:

1) Open the group project grpTest.vbg, you may get a missing dependency error, that is ok..
2) You will see two projects, select HyperListDll in the project explorer window, and click project > references. You will probably see an entry 'Misssing: QS5 Storm..', uncheck it.
3) Click browse, and navigate to the \Tlb subfolder included with the project, (if you do not see the qs5lib.tlb file, change the 'File Type' to .tlb).
4) Select the qs5lib.tlb file, and save the project.
5) Repeat for the prjHyperHarness project if necessary.
6) Yes, it really is that simple..
7) Have fun..


.:Usercontrol Version:.

The usercontrol requires the OleGuids3.tlb during design time, (it has no dependencies on compiled control)
In the UserControl folder, click the Run Me.vbg group. Highlite the usercontrol in the project explorer. Go to the Project > References menu. Browse to the Tlb folder, and add a reference to the OleGuids3.tlb type library, then save the project.
