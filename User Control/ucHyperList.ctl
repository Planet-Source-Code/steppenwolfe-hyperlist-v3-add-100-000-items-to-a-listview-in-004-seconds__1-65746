'~*** Notes ***~

'* Credits/Cudos/More info..
'~ A big shout out to Carles 'da man!' PV, for his awesome api listview:
'~ http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=56021&lngWId=1
'~ Much of the HyperList class was derived from Carles example, and without Carles great demo of styles and methods
'~ this demonstration would have been much harder, (if not impossible), to create.
'~ Steve 'big Steve' McMahon, and his unparalleled listview control:
'~ http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Controls/ListView/article.asp
'~ if it is possible to do it with a listview, Steve has demonstrated it with this control, and as always,
'~ a great wealth of information and inspiration lies in the source code of this control.
'~ Rohan 'the Sort Monster' RDE, for his incredible QSort routines:
'~ http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=63800&lngWId=1
'~ The Qsort routines are a simply inspirational use of refined logic and methods.
'~ and of course, as per usual, a (weak and confusing) reference per M$:

'* Where it began..
'~ I first realized I had a need for something like this while benching an application I am currently writing.
'~ The app, could return 20k results in .2 seconds, ('that's a good thing' tm.), but, it took 9 seconds to write results
'~ into a highly optimized grid control, (that is a bad thing ;o()
'~ This is when I began my search for a faster method of committing results to a data container control.
'~ I had heard of a virtual list, it is something used primarily in the C++ world for linking large databases to a list control.
'~ I searched the internet for hours, but the only example of this I could find was a rather dated VB5 example on
'~ mvps.org. This example was incomplete, there was no storage solution, no sorting, a very old, (and very unstable), subclassing component,
'~ and most of the listview properties simply weren't implemented. The code was also, (I think unnecessarily..), complex,
'~ perhaps the reason why on one has expanded on it for some time. The mvps example uses a listview embedded in a user control
'~ to manage callback information, and an object pointer 'swap' (that still has me confused.. ;o).
'~ I decided to do this in a completely different way, the way you would create a listview in C++, by using CreateWindowEx
'~ to invoke the listview class, and adding the LVS_OWNERDATA flag, which lets the list know, data will be managed externally.
'~ Most of the other methods used are simply passing flags into the list via sendmessage, with a few notable exceptions..
'~ Checkboxes are a serious pain to implement in a virtual listview, simply passing the flag into a list does nothing, rather
'~ it is necessary to track the item state, and intercept callbacks to parse the checkbox click event, then simply mark the
'~ check state in an array, and then invalidate the list, forcing a repaint.
'~ Quite obviously, sorting and storage are also handled very differently. Very little of the listviews internal
'~ structures are used, data is not copied into the list, and can not be manipulated through the lists interfaces.
'~ So methods had to be constructed to manage these functions. The Item and SubItem arrays can be used to
'~ sort the data, with sorted data then being accessed through an indexed pointer array.
'~ These methods are far faster then using a listviews built in methods, (ever try to sort 100,000 items in a listview?
'~ wouldn't recommend it.. ;o)
'~ The memory access type lib, includes various functions to both memory and string functions, and the internal vb
'~ PutMem/GetMem functions. Benches demonstrated that on a compiled library, the type lib was consistantly faster
'~ then using api declarations. (experiment with caution :~0}

'* What can it do?
'~ Well.. it is simply the fastest listview control it is possible to make! It can load a million items in
'~ the blink of an eye, or sort 100 thousand items in a fraction of a second.
'~ This is, (after many hours of searching the net would seem to indicate..), the only fully implemented
'~ example of a virtual listview in vb. It has a complete sorting and storage apparatus, that are about as
'~ fast as you can make them in this language.
'~ It is ownerdrawn, which means that styles can be manipulated far beyond what can be accomplished with
'~ a standard listview.
'~ Headers are subclassed as a simple demo, but could be expanded dramatically, (like tiling image in
'~ place of header for modern mp3 player styles). Sky is the limit people, where you take it, is up to you..

'~ Release 1.0 - June 23, 2006
'~ Still a few todo's.. icons aren't working right yet, not sure why..
'~ A couple other routines need some, work, maybe this weekend..

'~ Release 2.0 - June 26, 2006
'~ Icon issues (partially) resolved, a few fixes here and there, and a uc version for people who can't live without it..

'~ Release 3.0 - June 29, 2006
'~ Icon issues are resolved, (in both versions). Added tab focus intercept in dll version, and ipao in
'~ uc version. Leak in dll harness resolved. Unless bugs are found, or I add a couple more features down
'~ the road, this should be it.. (3000 times faster then a standard listview, not bad.. ;o)

'~ Enjoy..
