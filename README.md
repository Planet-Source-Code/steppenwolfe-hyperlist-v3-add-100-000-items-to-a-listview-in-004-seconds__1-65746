### Description

A fully implemented virtual/stateful listview control, with unbelievable speed. Built in storage and sorting capabilities, with database connector options. Owner drawn, with potential and methods demonstrated for more serious modifications.

Many extended styles and methods demonstrated, in what is, without a doubt, the fastest fully implemented listview control in visual basic.

----

V2 Is Up!

Fixed a few things, added icons to some views, and added a usecontrol version.

----

V3 Is Up!

Icon problems resolved in both uc and dll versions. Tab control also added to both revisions.

Have fun..

Cheers

John
